# Webdev-assignment-1
The majority of the information and images have been sourced from Wikipedia, the main exception being the banner, which was taken by me.

During this assignment, I faced a good few challenges initially. I decided to start by figuring out the layout of my pages, first designing the navigation and banner, and then figuring out the rest during this, the biggest challenge was learning bootstrap's grid system, everything else was fairly simple, just very time consuming to tweak all the css until it looked right.

The navigation especially took a LOT of tweaking as the elements were interacting in ways I did not expect within the css. Making the header scale with screen size was also a nightmare since everything interacted differently as screen sizes changed so I had to specify different CSS for some screen sizes in some cases.

The design is very simplistic. I went for a darker colour scheme as it's easy on the eyes (and I was primarily coding this at night) and looks relatively pleasing.

After finishing the overall design and designating it a general css file, the rest was simple enough as all the pages were mostly styled correctly and all that was left was the content.
