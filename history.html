                <h1>History</h1>
                <h2>Early history</h2>
                <p>Slavic Lechitic tribes first moved into the area in the 8th century though there has been evidence of settlements dating back to the 7th century. During the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieszko_I_of_Poland">Mieszko I of poland</a>, there was a fortified settlement built there in 1149 which went on to become the residence of the high dukes of Poland.</p>
                <p>Legnica became famous for the battle that took place during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Mongol_invasion_of_Poland">first mongol invasion</a>, where Polish, Bavarian and Czech troops fought against the mongols, but were ultimately defeated.</p>
                <img src="Images/monastery.jpg" alt="Dominican monastery">
                <p>Despite the battle, the city kept rapidly developing. In 1258, what is believed to be the first parish school was established at the church of St. Peter. Then, in 1278, a dominican monastery was established, and became the burial place of Boles≈Çaw II, who is also the only monarch to have been buried in Legnica.</p>
                <p>The city kept growing at a rapid pace, establishing a city council by 1300 and new trade privileges allowing for the construction of a town hall and the first water works in 1337. Coins started being produced at the local mint shortly after, and by the 14th century walls were erected around the city.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2>14th to 17th century</h2>
                <p>At the beginning of the 14th century, Legnica was one of the most important cities in Central Europe, being the capital of the Duchy of legnica and having a population of almost 16,000 people.</p>
                <p>The discovery of gold in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaczawa">Kaczawa river</a> caused the city to expand even quicker. Unfortunately this could not be maintained and it quickly reached its maximum population, shortly after, many of the old wooden buildings burned down in a large fire. This fire effectively halted all progress on the city and greatly reduced the number of inhabitants</p>
                <img src="Images/Piast.jpg" alt="Image of Piast castle">
                <p>Following this, during the 14th century, the city became a vassal of the kingdom of Bohemia and was included in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, but remained ruled by local dukes of the Piast dynasty. In 1454, a rebellion prevented legnica from falling under the direct rule of the Bohemian kings.</p>
                <p>In 1522, the Protestand Reformation was introduced and a protestant university was established, unfortunately it did not last long and was closed only 3 years later.</p>
                <p>Then the city fell into a very rough patch, being affected by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War">Thirty Year's War</a> and having a plauge break out in 1633, followed by the Austrian army destroying the suburbs.</p>
                <p>Then in 1675 Legnica fell under the Habsburg rule after the last Piast duke passed away despite the inheritance pact by Brandenburg and Silesia. The last Piast duke was buried in St John's church.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2>Modern history</h2>
                <p>By 1910, most of Legnica's population was german. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, Legnica became part of the Province of Lower Silesia</p>
                <p>Once the nazi party came into power, the local Polish population was persecuted and terrorized with a nazi court prison being operated in the city.</p>
                <p>During the second world war, many members of the Polish resistance movement were imprisoned there. The germans then set up two more forced labour camps</p>
                <p>Once world war 2 ended, Legnica was transferred back to Poland with the majority of the german population being either forcefully kicked out or fleeing from the city, allowing it to repopulate with Poles and pre-war expellees from after the annexation by the soviet union.</p>
                <p>By 1990, only a small number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonization">Polonized</a> germans and pre-war citizens of Legnica remained of the pre-1945 population.</p>
