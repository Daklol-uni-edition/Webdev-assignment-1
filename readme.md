Overall, this assignment posed a large deal of challenges, primarily with trying to figure out bootstrap's grid system and how the elements interact with eachother as some behaviours were a struggle to figure out
Some of the CSS also posed a bit of a challenge, primarily the navigation, I couldn't figure out how to apply the styles to the text inside the buttons for a while as no matter what I tried it simply would not style it.
It was also a challenge to figure out what to write, aside from the history there isn't much to the town

As for design choices, I went with a simple dark style for the whole thing as it is easy on the eyes and fairly pleasing to look at.
The layout for each page is roughly the same, just 2 columns of content, this layout allowed me to easily split my content and include images and such near relevant text without much difficulty.
